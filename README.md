<h1>Airport Baggage Router</h1>

Denver International Airport has decided to give an automated baggage system 
another shot. The hardware and tracking systems from the previous attempt are 
still in place, they just need a system to route the baggage. The system will 
route baggage checked, connecting, and terminating in Denver. You have been 
asked to implement a system that will route bags to their flights or the 
proper baggage claim. The input describes the airport conveyor system, the 
departing flights, and the bags to be routed. The output is the optimal 
routing to get bags to their destinations. Bags with a flight id of “ARRIVAL” are terminating in Denver are routed to Baggage Claim.

Below is the project structure.  It contains all source code, 
build files, and a gradle binary for building the code.  

The code uses dijkstra's algorithm to find the most optimum path from start 
to end node given a set of directed edges.  Only the optimized route is 
returned, i.e., the minimum number of node hops from start node to end node.  
Time is not considered when computing the optimized route.  It is assumed 
that fewer hops means a shorter travel time.

The program has limited input validation.  Currently only supports that each
section of input contains the appropriate number of fields. If the number of 
fields for a given line of input is not sufficient, an InvalidInputException is
thrown internally, and an error message is written to stdout telling the user
which line of input is invalid.

Below is described the input fields.  As mentioned, input validation is limited. 
For example, it is assumed for section 1 input that the travel time is in 
minutes defined as a whole number integer.  So, a decimal notation in these
fields will cause a NumberFormatException at runtime with no further explanation.
Due to time constraints only one aspect of input validation was considered 
to demonstrate how the program would handle errors.     

Input: The input consists of several sections. The beginning of each section 
is marked by a line starting: “# Section:” 

Section 1: A weighted bi-directional graph describing the conveyor system.
Format: <Node 1> <Node 2> <travel_time (Integers Only)>

Section 2: Departure list Format:
<flight_id> <flight_gate> <destination> <flight_time>

Section 3: Bag list Format:
<bag_number> <entry_point> <flight_id>



If input is valid, an output file is written, "airport-baggage.out".  Again
limited input validation occurs in the program.  

 > cat airport-baggage.out
<pre>
0001 Concourse_A_Ticketing A5 A1 : 11
0002 A5 A1 A2 A3 A4 : 9
0003 A2 A1 : 1
0004 A8 A9 A10 A5 : 6
0005 A7 A8 A9 A10 A5 BaggageClaim : 12
</pre>

The output : The optimized route for each bag.  The program only takes 
into consideration the shortest number of hops from the starting node to 
the ending node.  Time is current not considered when determining the optimized
route.  However, the total travel time is computed for each optimal route
and written to the output file.

<Bag_Number> <point_1> <point_2> [<point_3>, …] : <total_travel_time>
